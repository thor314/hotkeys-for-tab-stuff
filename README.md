# Hotkeys for Tab Stuff
Maybe you wanted to move a tab. A little bit to the left. Bump over a window.

Your eyes flash toward *the clicky*. The clicky interface that you spent hours teaching your parents and grandparents to use, so that they could forward spam political emails to you. Your ADHD reminds you to set up a filter, but you manage to stay focused on this page long enough to read another 2 paragraphs. 

*The clicky*. It will not do. The keyboard, now that's an interface for the modern micro-optimizer like you, Tim.

Maybe instead, you wanted to open the blue microblogging site at the press of a button. Yes, the blue microblogging site that you addictively check. Perhaps it would be less addictive if opening it were even easier. No, that seems unlikely, but you're long past the point of return, and you're in the market for *convenience*. 

You want *hotkeys*? For tab stuff? You might want **Hotkeys for Tab Stuff.**

*You: I'm not paying you for purple prose, just give me the features*

I'm not asking for your money Tim. It's *free crud*. No capitalism behind my back, not even a sneaky-deeky advertisement. Here's the features. 

Move selected tabs around, defaults to current tab:
- Alt , -- move tab(s) left
- Alt . -- move tab(s) right
- Alt < -- move tab(s) all the way left
- Alt > -- move tab(s) all the way right
- Ctrl Alt , -- move tab(s) to previous window
- Ctrl Alt . -- move tab(s) to next window
- Ctrl Alt n -- move tab(s) to new window
- Ctrl Alt h -- extend select next tab left 
- Ctrl Alt l -- extend select next tab right
- ? -- bankrupt-bookmark all tabs in a folder called date and close window

And 20 (yes you heard it, 20) slots to assign a hotkey to open a page, or even a folder of bookmarks. 

All hotkeys can be set to different keys in extension settings. 
Ctrl Shift A to open extension settings in Firefox. 
chrome://extensions/ in Chrome (assuming I get around to Chrome).

This extension is smol and simple, like old times, without the something-ism. No, no feature bloat here Tim. If you want more complex functionality, like vim keys or a horizontal tab sidebar, this lil guy probably integrates nicely with those extensions, without getting in the way.

If I managed to ever so slightly improve your life, pass the proverbial buck by giving this a review in the extension store, or maybe give this repo a star on Github. If I failed, besmirch [my rotten name](https://twitter.com/cryptograthor) on social media.

Now be free, Tim.
